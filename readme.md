## Readme

This project provides support for a physical mute button on your desk for Teams and other apps that need a quick mic mute option.

See [demo video](https://1drv.ms/v/s!AoS-ymEfLuCLr4wCEUijRxuqnuLoKA).

If you set `TaskbarLauncher` as your Startup Project in Visual Studio and run it then it installs a task bar icon that looks like a microphone:

This icon provides a window that you can open to see your current system mute state:

If you also have a [Texas Instruments SensorTag device](https://www.mouser.com/new/texas-instruments/ti-cc2650stk-kit/) then if you pair this device with your Windows machine then the left button on the device will toggle your system microphone mute state.
